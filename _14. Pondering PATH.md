# `PATH` variable

It is due to the path shell variable that the shell is able to find commands like ls. If this variable gets changed it won't be able to find those commands. 

To set the path we use `PATH="/"`

### `which` command
This is a command that is used to find where a specific builtin command is present in the `PATH` directory 
It is used as `which <command>`


# Challenges

## 1. The `path` variable

In this level, you will disrupt the operation of the `/challenge/run` program. This program will **DELETE** the flag file using the `rm` command. However, if it can't find the `rm` command, the flag will not be deleted, and the challenge will give it to you! Thus, you must make it so that `/challenge/run` also can't find the `rm` command!

```bash
PATH=""
/challenge/run
```

Output flag:-pwn.college{8Q1DDx_af5wsZUBYyRz6W8GIrAZ.QX2cDM1wCM2YTMzEzW}

## 2. Setting path
Let's practice. This level's `/challenge/run` will run the `win` command via its bare name, but this command exists in the `/challenge/more_commands/` directory, which is not initially in the PATH. The `win` command is the _only_ thing that `/challenge/run` needs, so you can just overwrite `PATH` with that one directory. Good luck!

```bash
PATH="/challenge/more_commands"
/challenge/run
```

Output flag:-pwn.college{4wf6axnf_54DCGjAL3Wnm8usc9E.QX1cjM1wCM2YTMzEzW}

## 3. Finding commands

In this challenge, we added a `win` command somewhere in your `$PATH`, but it won't give you the flag. Instead, it's in the same directory as a `flag` file that we made readable by you! You must find `win` (with the `which` command), and `cat` the flag out of that directory!

```bash
which win
cat ls /challenge/paths/17659/flag
```

Output flag:-pwn.college{gDcChB5db88ISJMDWWmk0ummuuL.01NzEzNxwCM2YTMzEzW}

## 4. Adding commands

Previously, the `win` command that `/challenge/run` executed was stored in `/challenge/more_commands`. This time, `win` does not exist! Recall the final level of [Chaining Commands](https://pwn.college/linux-luminarium/chaining), and make a shell script called `win`, add its location to the `PATH`, and enable `/challenge/run` to find it!

```bash
nano win
```

Contents of win file

```bash
PATH="/usr/bin"
cat /flag
```

```bash
chmod u+x win
PATH="~"
/challenge/run
```

Output flag:-pwn.college{oX4x-VBpuocBEU6cuFABHvbeuBK.QX2cjM1wCM2YTMzEzW}

## 5. Hijacking commands

Armed with your knowledge, you can now carry out some shenanigans. This challenge is almost the same as the first challenge in this module. Again, this challenge will delete the flag using the `rm` command. But unlike before, it will _not_ print anything out for you.

```bash
nano rm
```

The contents of the rm file
```bash
PATH="/usr/bin"
chmod u+r /flag
cat /flag
```

```bash
chmod u+x rm
PATH="~"
/challenge/run
```
