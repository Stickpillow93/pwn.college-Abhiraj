## What is a command line?

1. It is define as a powerful interface to a computer.
2. We type in commands into it and the computer outputs the results 
3. Example:- cat key.pub in this program the first part of the program or "cat" is the name of the program and the second part is the name of the file. This displays the output of the contents of key.pub. 

## Command parameters:-

1. These command parameters are also called as arguments. 
2. Example:- "echo -n hello hackers!" Argument over here is -n which changes the functionality of the program by forcing the code to not print a new line after execution. 
3. Example ```date --utc``` 

# MOST IMPORTANT: -

_THE CREATOR OF LINUX HATES NVIDIA. DUE TO THEM NOT PROVIDING OPEN SOURCE DRIVERS._
THIS FORCES OPEN SOURCE DEVELOPERS TO DO THE WORK OF NVIDIA. SO SCREW YOU NVIDIA 


## Challenge 1 (intro to commands):- 

In this level, invoke the `hello` command to get the flag! Keep in mind: commands in Linux are case sensitive: `hello` is different from `HELLO`.

```bash
hello
```


Output flag:-pwn.college{QAdlMqL24IB7I93DkV82Ggg1aSs.QX3YjM1wCM2YTMzEzW}


## Challenge 2(Intro to arguments):- 

We must run the hello command with a single argument of hackers. 

``` bash
hello hackers 
```

Output flag:-
pwn.college{0Odrj0sD6JZ8SMIIisOHoxnsFws.QX4YjM1wCM2YTMzEzW}
## Challenge 3(Command History):-

Use the up key or down arrow key to view the past codes we have run as the shell saves every single command we execute. 

Output flag:-
pwn.college{MQpeu1hP2LbkMHSV0AJYUdzDqHn.0lNzEzNxwCM2YTMzEzW}
