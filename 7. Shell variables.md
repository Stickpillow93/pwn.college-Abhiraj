A variable is always referenced by `$<variable name>`

# Setting variable value

While setting the variable name we use `variable=18`

If we write that as `variable = 18` it will be considered invalid because the shell will try to run the variable command

To set multiple lines as a variable name we use 
`variable="HEllo frauds"`


## Exporting variables

If you want the variable to also be used in other processes other than the current one we have to use `export <var_name>`

```bash
var=fraud
export var
```

Now this variable var will contain the value fraud even in other process. 


# Env command

The env command can be used to print out every single exported variable in the current shell


# Command substitution

We can use this to store the output of a given command in a variable 

```bash
flag=$(cat /flag)
echo "$flag"
```

Output is the contents of the flag file 


# Reading input

To read the input as a prompt in the shell we use 
```bash
read -p "Input:" var
echo $var
```

Output:
```bash
Input:fraud
fraud
```

To give file input to a variable 

```bash
echo "information" > file
read VAR < file
echo $VAR
```

Output:
```bash
information
```


## 1. Challenge

Let's start with printing variables out. The `/challenge/run` program will not, and cannot, give you the flag, but that's okay, because the flag has been put into the variable called "FLAG"! Just have your shell print it out!

```bash
echo $FLAG
```

Output flag :-pwn.college{gg71l3vtFQxvLz4kk2wz2uvv4Oi.QX3UTN0wCM2YTMzEzW}

## 2. Challenge

To solve this level, you must set the `PWN` variable to the value `COLLEGE`.

```bash
PWN=COLLEGE
```

Output flag:-pwn.college{oIvs9RCCPOzeonLHnHobiTPiYW6.QX5UTN0wCM2YTMzEzW}

## 3. Challenge

 In this level, you'll need to set the variable `PWN` to `COLLEGE YEAH`.

```bash
PWN="COLLEGE YEAH"
```

Output flag:-pwn.college{MelcUH2mbuhyMhUEpzVosI_y2NX.QXwYTN0wCM2YTMzEzW}

## 4. Challenge

In this challenge, you must invoke `/challenge/run` with the `PWN` variable exported and set to the value `COLLEGE`, and the `COLLEGE` variable set to the value `PWN` but _not_ exported (e.g., not inherited by `/challenge/run`).

```bash
export PWN=COLLEGE
COLLEGE=PWN
/challenge/run
```

Output flag:-pwn.college{go6p-twLlW-SRb8aPlAcYEufA7l.QXyYTN0wCM2YTMzEzW}


## 5. Challenge

Try the `env` command: it'll print out every _exported_ variable set in your shell, and you can look through that output to find the `FLAG` variable!

```bash
env
```

Output flag:- pwn.college{8XYfzU9YNii7rlsw5l8YRM8L0R2.QX4UTN0wCM2YTMzEzW}

## 6. Challenge

 Read the output of the /challenge/run command directly into a variable called PWN, and it will contain the flag!

```bash
PWN=$(/challenge/run)
echo $PWN
```

Output flag:-pwn.college{Y08T02nZLaSXVzACyXsAABB3C1_.QX1cDN1wCM2YTMzEzW}

## 7. Challenge

In this challenge, your job is to use `read` to set the `PWN` variable to the value `COLLEGE`.

```bash
read -p "INPUT:" PWN
```

Output flag:-pwn.college{8jDtna_eVbRkHZ_JSXMh4g7InNy.QX4cTN0wCM2YTMzEzW}

## 8. Challenge

Now, use that to read /challenge/read_me into the PWN environment variable, and we'll give you the flag! The /challenge/read_me will keep changing, so you'll need to read it right into the PWN variable with one command

```bash
read PWN < /challenge/read_me
```

Output flag:
pwn.college{o_9qMjKbUZPJfQTjsoWOICQyipT.QXwIDO0wCM2YTMzEzW}
