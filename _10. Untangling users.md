The /etc/passwd contains the list of all users in the given computer

The root user contains all privileges and can basically do whatever he wants.

# `su` command 

This is an outdated command that is used to gain root privileges of a system. 

It asks for a password and compares it to the password of root user. 

It is outdated as nowadays root users are becoming rare. 

we can use `su <user_name>` to login as another user

# Cracking passwords

The password is stored in the file /etc/shadow in the form of encrypted hashes and is only given access in the form of encrypted hash. 

We can use applications like `john` which decrypt the password after a leak.

`john <file containing hash`

# `sudo` command

The `sudo` command is used as a substitute to `su` command instead of opening a shell that allows the user to put in commands as a root user it instead checks on a command basis whether the policies to use root privileges are granted to a user.  


# Challenges:-

## 1. Becoming root with `su`

```bash
su #enter the password as hack-the-planet
cat /flag #while in root mode
```

Output flag:-pwn.college{sd9Q95Zn4LqZe9Ahum8S7UYZZVd.QX1UDN1wCM2YTMzEzW}

# 2. Other users with su
In this level, you must switch to the `zardus` user and then run `/challenge/run`. Zardus' password is `dont-hack-me`.

```bash
su zardus #enter e/the password
/challenge/run
```

Output flag:-pwn.college{okuRxb9i5V6NIWGZScNwEJ66oT_.QX2UDN1wCM2YTMzEzW}

# 3. Cracking passwords

This level simulates this story, giving you a leak of `/etc/shadow` (in `/challenge/shadow-leak`). Crack it (this could take a few minutes), `su` to `zardus`, and run `/challenge/run` to get the flag!

```bash
john /challenge/shadow-leak
su zardus # password is aardvark
/challenge/run
```

Output flag:-pwn.college{wY4RkXXUFEwd_AiwNgvoihkf0yn.QX3UDN1wCM2YTMzEzW}

# 4. using sudo

In this level, we will give you `sudo` access, and you will use it to read the flag

```bash
sudo cat /flag
```

Output flag:-pwn.college{weIOX2t5G_HVp8ArMuBAqOv3q2l.QX4UDN1wCM2YTMzEzW}
