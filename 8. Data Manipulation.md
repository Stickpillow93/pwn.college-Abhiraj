# `tr` command

`tr` command translates the character provided in the first argument to the character provided in the second argument. It is always used with piping

Example
```bash
echo own | tr o p
```

Output:-
`pwn`

Example:-
```bash
echo pwm.collage | tr ma ne
```

Output:-
`pwn.college`

## Deleting characters

We can use the `-d` argument to delete some characters from the output

Example:-
```bash
echo pawn | tr -d a
```

Output:-
`pwn`

## Newlines:-

`_` is defined as the new space character and we can replace that with "\n" in order to get lines

```bash
echo "hello_word" | tr "_" "\n"
```

Output:- 
```
hello
world
```
``
# `head` command

The `head` is used to only get the output of the first 10 lines
The argument `-n` is used to specify the number of lines

Example:-
```bash
cat /something/very/long | head
```

```
this
is
just 
the
first 
ten 
lines 
of 
the
```

# `cut` command 

This command is used to find certain information from an output
```bash
cut -d " " -f 3 scores.txt
```

In the above command the `-d " "` tell that the columns are separated by spaces and -f 3 is asking to give the output of the third column from scores.txt

# `sort` command

Sort command helps organise data.
By default, `sort` orders lines alphabetically. Arguments can change this:

- `-r`: reverse order (Z to A)
- `-n`: numeric sort (for numbers)
- `-u`: unique lines only (remove duplicates)
- `-R`: random order!


# Challenges

## 1. Translating Characters

`/challenge/run` will print the flag but will swap the casing of all characters (e.g., `A` will become `a` and vice-versa). Can you undo it with `tr` and get the flag?

```bash
/challenge/run | tr QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJKLZXCVBNMqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnmQWERTYUIOPASDFGHJKLZXCVBNM
```

Output flag:-pwn.college{YDrin25dJtkZ-mjB10V5S0c2aAf.01MxEzNxwCM2YTMzEzW}

## 2. Deleting characters

 I'll intersperse some decoy characters (specifically: `^` and `%`) among the flag characters. Use `tr -d` to remove them!

```bash
/challenge/run | tr -d "^%"
```

Output flag:-pwn.college{Uc8bIoYvcZ4Kl5olTWZUMpzCVXn.0FNxEzNxwCM2YTMzEzW}

## 3. Deleting newlines

 In this challenge, we'll inject a bunch of newlines into the flag. Delete them with `tr`'s `-d` flag and the _escaped_ newline specification!

```bash
/challenge/run | tr -d "\n"
```

Output flag:-pwn.college{QwMxeBV3yMoj_-9WoWMuH_uxW1S.0VNxEzNxwCM2YTMzEzW}

## 4. Extracting the first lines with head

This challenge's `/challenge/pwn` outputs a bunch of data, and you'll need to pipe it through `head` to grab just the first 7 lines and then pipe them onwards to `/challenge/college`, which will give you the flag if you do this right! Your solution will be a long composite command with _two_ pipes connecting three commands. Good luck!

```bash
/challenge/pwn | head -n 7 | /challenge/college
```

Output flag:-pwn.college{A6KrMYLzFPANEnHbKXW2HZfFfXA.0lNxEzNxwCM2YTMzEzW}


## 5.Extracting specific sections of text

In this challenge, the `/challenge/run` program will give you a bunch of lines with random numbers and single characters (characters of the flag) as columns. Use `cut` to extract the flag characters, then pipe them to `tr -d "\n"` (like the previous level!) to join them together into a single line.

```bash
/challenge/run | cut -d " " -f 2 | tr -d "\n"
```

Output flag:-pwn.college{Q1fOnPWQpe-ino2jHq_kVhB7Edw.01NxEzNxwCM2YTMzEzW}

## 6. Sorting data

In this challenge, there's a file at `/challenge/flags.txt` containing 100 fake flags, with the real flag mixed among them. When sorted alphabetically, the real flag will be at the end (we made sure of this when generating fake flags). Go get it!

```bash
sort /challenge/flags.txt
```

Output flag:-pwn.college{sOBhI_b_fR-mAGBqriEtKs6ohpC.0FM0MDOxwCM2YTMzEzW}
