The easiest way to chain commands is to use the `;` 

For example we can do something like:-

```bash
echo college > pwn; cat pwn
```

The output of this will `college`

## `&&` operator
The `&&` operator is used to chain commands in such a way that the second one will only execute if the first one is successful. 

```bash
touch /file && /challenge/run
```

Over here if /file write access is not given the program won't execute the output and even the second one won't execute. 

## `||` operator
The `||` operator is used to execute the second command only if the first one fails

```bash
touch /file || echo "failure"
```

Over here after /file fails due to lack of permission failure will be echod 

##  Shell script

We can put all of the commands we want to execute in one file called a shell script file. It has sh suffix. 
```bash
nano x.sh # here we put two commands 
```

After putting in the commands we want it to execute we run it using the `bash` command

Example
```bash
bash x.sh
```

We can invoke a shell script without using bash if we convert it 

### Shebangs and script execution

In Linux the system doesn't rely on the file extension to execute command it instead reads the first line of the program to understand which interpreter to use. 

Some common shebangs(which is the first line information)

- `#!/bin/bash` for bash scripts
- `#!/usr/bin/python3` for Python scripts
- `#!/bin/sh` for POSIX shell scripts
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello Hackers!"
```
The above is an example of file without file extension that can work to execute a file. 


### Arguments

Script files can also accept arguments in the file with the use `$1` The arguments are called when executing the file like `./script.sh hello` over here hello is taken as the `$1` 

```bash
echo "$1"
```

The above text is put in script file then the output will be the input printed out.

### Conditionals

```bash
if [ "$1" == "ping" ] 
then 
	echo "pong" 
elif [ "$1" == "fraud" ]
then
	echo "fraud"
else
then
	echo "nope"
fi
```
This is how the script will look like for if statements remember the spaces before and after `[]` also the `fi` is the terminator of the statement


# Challenges

## 1. Chaining with semicolons
 you must run `/challenge/pwn` and then `/challenge/college`, chaining them with a semicolon.

```bash
/challenge/pwn ; /challenge/challenge
```

Output flag:-pwn.college{M0A4OWFzWGGMXJTISj1w19o3cnh.QX1UDO0wCM2YTMzEzW}

## 2. Building on success
you need to chain the programs `/challenge/first-success` and `/challenge/second` using the `&&` operato

```bash
/challenge/first-success && /challenge/second
```

Output flag:-pwn.college{ogoQMfe0vq90YdGIZyys5Lv1oAr.0lM0MDOxwCM2YTMzEzW}

## 3. Handling Failure
In this challenge, you need to chain `/challenge/first-failure` and `/challenge/second` using the `||` operator. Go for it!

```bash
/challenge/first-failure || /challenge/second
```

Output flag:-pwn.college{wOJwVEU_L4OAC_dhu9sEva36o-V.01M0MDOxwCM2YTMzEzW}

## 4. First shell script
 Same as last level, run `/challenge/pwn` and then `/challenge/college`, but this time in a shell script called `x.sh`, then run it with `bash`!
 
```bash
nano x.sh # put in /chalenge/pwn and /challenge/college
bash x.sh
```

Output flag:-pwn.college{wlyWVx-t5e9NhNyHv9mVSsc1ymJ.QXxcDO0wCM2YTMzEzW}

## 5. Redirecting script output
In this level, we will practice piping (`|`) from your script to another program. Like before, you need to create a script that calls the `/challenge/pwn` command followed by the `/challenge/college` command, and pipe the output of the script into a single invocation of the `/challenge/solve` command!

```bash
bash x.sh | /challenge/solve
```

Output flag:-pwn.college{kRBsToQlnll4j9VcB-yaiJjFVOU.QX4ETO0wCM2YTMzEzW}

## 6. Executable shell script
Make a shellscript that will invoke `/challenge/solve`, make it executable, and run it without explicitly invoking `bash`!

```bash
nano x.sh # edit the file with /challenge/solve
chmod u+x x.sh
./x.sh
```

Output flag:-pwn.college{o5WtKbz-eaIx6TazYnm1FpyanCk.QX0cjM1wCM2YTMzEzW}

## 7. Understanding shebangs

For this challenge, create a script at `/home/hacker/solve.sh` that has a proper shebang and outputs "hack the planet". Remember to make it executable, then run `/challenge/run` to verify your script works correctly!

```bash
nano solve.sh
```

What we must enter in the file
```
#!/bin/bash
echo "hack the planet"
```

```bash
chmod u+x solve.sh
/challenge/run
```

Output flag:-pwn.college{4aokuimK7kYo40s73F9KNjrYGZ6.0VOzMDOxwCM2YTMzEzW}

## 8. Scripting with arguments

For this challenge, you need to write a script at `/home/hacker/solve.sh` that:
1. Takes two arguments
2. Outputs them in REVERSE order (second argument first, then the first argument)

```bash
nano solve.sh
```
in solve.sh
```
echo "$2 $1"
```

```bash
/challenge/run
```

Output flag:-pwn.college{czqbSKSvFILtoR3HZX9ThiFVT2Z.0VNzMDOxwCM2YTMzEzW}

## 9. Scripting with conditionals

For this challenge, write a script at `/home/hacker/solve.sh` that:
- Takes one argument
- If the argument is "pwn", output "college"
- For any other input, output nothing

```bash
if [ "$1" == "pwn" ]
then
echo "college"
fi
```

Output flag:-pwn.college{U2GXXvCiduKb5ZJ4NgUvMXPI9z8.0lNzMDOxwCM2YTMzEzW}

## 10. Scripting with default cases

For this challenge, write a script at `/home/hacker/solve.sh` that:
- Takes one argument
- If the argument is "pwn", output "college"
- For any other input, output "nope"

```bash
if [ "$1" == "pwn" ]
then
echo "college"
else
echo "nope"
fi
```

Output flag:-pwn.college{UixWcVmtPm6Nvpf4U3p04vcQ0wS.01NzMDOxwCM2YTMzEzW}

## 11. Scripting with multiple conditions

or this challenge, write a script at `/home/hacker/solve.sh` that:
- Takes one argument
- If the argument is "hack", output "the planet"
- If the argument is "pwn", output "college"
- If the argument is "learn", output "linux"
- For any other input, output "unknown"

```bash
if [ "$1" == "pwn" ]
then
echo "college"
elif [ "$1" == "hack" ]
then
echo "the planet"
elif [ "$1" == "learn" ]
then
echo "linux"
else
echo "unknown"
fi
```

Output flag:-pwn.college{8uNtCY1c0-bi_ZvwVx8sTGWAj3_.0FOzMDOxwCM2YTMzEzW}

## 12. Reading shell scripts

In this level, we will learn to read shell scripts. `/challenge/run` is a shell script that requires you to put in a secret password, but that password is hardcoded into the script iself! Read the script (using, say, `cat`), figure out the password, and get the flag!

```bash
cat /challenge/run
/challenge/run #then give input as #hACK THE PLANET
```

Output flag:-pwn.college{kXqK0gRLZ3Y8jqK2ZXX-ehf9iQf.0lMwgDOxwCM2YTMzEzW}
