# `screen` command

`screen` is a program that creates virtual terminal inside a terminal. 

we can use `ctrl + a + d` to detach from the session and then use the command `screen -r` if we want to reconnect to a detached version of screen

`screen -ls` is used to find the list of running screen

These windows are handled with different keyboard shortcuts, all starting with `Ctrl-A`:

- `Ctrl-A c` - Create a new window
- `Ctrl-A n` - Next window
- `Ctrl-A p` - Previous window
- `Ctrl-A 0` through `Ctrl-A 9` - Jump directly to window 0-9
- `Ctrl-A "` - bring up a selection menu of all of the windows


# `tmux` command
`tmux` is the younger and more modern cousin of screen. 
It has different keybinds it has `ctrl + b`

- `tmux ls` - List sessions
- `tmux attach` or `tmux a` - Reattach to session
