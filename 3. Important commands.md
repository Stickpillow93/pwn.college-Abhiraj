## 11. Challenge
In this challenge, I have _hidden the flag_! Here, you will use `ls` and `cat` to follow my breadcrumbs and find it! Here's how it'll work:

0. Your first clue is in `/`. Head on over there.
1. Look around with `ls`. There'll be a file named HINT or CLUE or something along those lines!
2. `cat` that file to read the clue!
3. Depending on what the clue says, head on over to the next directory (or don't!).
4. Follow the clues to the flag!

```bash
cat SPOILER
cd /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/jedi/third_party/typeshed/third_party/2and3/cryptography/hazmat/primitives
ls -a
cat SECRET
cd /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/sympy/concrete/tests/__pycache__
ls -a
cd /usr/share/racket/pkgs/racket-doc/scribblings/getting-started
ls -a
cat BLUEPRINT 
cd /usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/pyformlang/fcfg
cat .INFO
cd /usr/share/help/eu
ls -a
cat .CLUE
cd /usr/share/racket/pkgs/scribble-lib/scribble/acmart/lang
ls -a
cat TEASER
cd /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/Cython/Build/__pycache__
ls -a
cat NOTE
ls /opt/linux/linux-5.4/include/uapi/linux/usb
cat /opt/linux/linux-5.4/include/uapi/linux/usb/INSIGHT-TRAPPED
```

Output flag :- pwn.college{M8pSpLILd6sMVr5ZROoDm2S3jli.QX5IDO0wCM2YTMzEzW}


# mkdir command

It is used to create a director syntax is mkdir "directory name"
## 12. Challenge:-

Make a directory /tmp/pwn and make a file college in it. Then run /challenge/run 

```bash
mkdir /tmp/pwn
touch /tmp/pwn/college
/challenge/run
```

Output flag:-pwn.college{U4eXe2YGj6zCwEQoxKvNeesXsmB.QXxMDO0wCM2YTMzEzW}


# find command
1. Used to look for files 
2. Takes many optional arguments like the subdirectory and the name 
3. Example find -name my_subfile

```bash
find -name flag
cat opt/busybox/busybox-1.33.2/include/config/subst/flag
```

Went through every single sub directory in root individually to find the /flag file since it was taking too much time to execute otherwise. 


# Linking files

When we link files editing one of the file is basically editing the other as well. 
There are two types of linking
1. Hard link:- This can be understood as when multiple address lead to the same place
2. Soft link:- When you move apartments and have the postal service automatically forward your mail from your old place to your new place. 

A hard link is an alternative address that indexes the data accesses to the hard link and accesses to the original file are completely identical.

A soft link only contains the file name. 

Syntax for soft link and hard link
1. Soft link ```ln -s "orignal_file" "new_link_file"```
2.  Hard link ```ln "orignal_file" "new_link_file"```
